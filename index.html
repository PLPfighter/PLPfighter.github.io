    <p>The choice between capitalist decay and an international communist future has never been clearer.</p>
    
<p>Covid-19 has laid bare the lethal racist inequalities of the profit system.
From the United States to Africa, from Latin America to South Asia, workers everywhere are suffering unnatural
deaths from the disease of capitalism.</p>



<p>Workers need a society run by workers for the health of all, not the profits and power of a few. </p>

<p>We need a society predicated on science to protect our class, the environment, and the planet that sustains us.
Only then will humanity flourish.</p>

<p>Join <a href="http://www.plp.org/">PLP</a> as we celebrate May Day!</p>
<p>May Day is our day, a day where we remember, celebrate, rededicate and reaffirm our determination
to carry the red flag of communist revolution forward!</p>
<p> WORKERS OF THE WORLD, UNITE WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BUT OUR CHAINS</P>
